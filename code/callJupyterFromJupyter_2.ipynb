    "- Choose the \"copy path\" option (This actually didn't get me the complete file path. Instead I went to the document I wanted in finder and clicked on the file, did COMMAND + OPTION + C to copy the file path, and then pasted it. As long as you have the complete file path, it will work... to make this reproducible, we would want the file path from the root of the github repository and we would copy the file path to there at the beginning and paste this end onto it) \n",
